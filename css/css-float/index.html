      <p>
        Monkeys are fascinating primates known for their intelligence, agility,
        and social behavior. They are found in diverse habitats across the
        world, from tropical rainforests to savannas. Monkeys are divided into
        two main groups: New World monkeys, which inhabit South and Central
        America, and Old World monkeys, found in Africa and Asia. These
        creatures exhibit a wide range of behaviors, from complex social
        structures and communication methods to tool use and problem-solving
        skills. Monkeys play a crucial role in their ecosystems by aiding in
        seed dispersal and maintaining the balance of their habitats. Their
        human-like traits and behaviors have made them a subject of extensive
        study and admiration.

      <h2>The Tiger</h2>

      <p>
        Tigers are majestic and powerful big cats, known for their striking
        orange coats with black stripes. As apex predators, they are vital to
        maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. Tigers are primarily found
        in Asia, with habitats ranging from the dense forests of India to the
        cold taigas of Siberia. These solitary animals are skilled hunters,
        relying on their stealth and strength to take down large prey. Each
        tiger's stripe pattern is unique, much like a human fingerprint. Despite
        their strength and adaptability, tigers face numerous threats, including
        habitat loss and poaching, leading to their status as an endangered
        species. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of
        these iconic creatures, which hold significant cultural and ecological
        importance.
